My current goal is to understand and explore the different patterns, to make them familiar and find ways to use them for this project and for the next ones.

The SuperCollider Pattern library provides a means of specifying dynamic structural transformations of musical processes.
In order to understand the framework, a number of concepts must be covered. These concepts are embodied in the classes for Streams, Patterns, and Events

## Streams ##
A stream represents a lazy sequence of values.

# Project Guidance #


I found myself quite often looking for solutions of technical problems or ideas, implementations and explenations on this forum,in the mailing list or at https://sccode.org/
 
I used to play with a friend that helped me a lot with the programming thing.
Here an extract of one of our projects:  https://youtu.be/BBi-QUU0x0I
Now it's not possible anymore to play togheter, but, to have the possibility of ask here, make me feel enough confidence to start my first project alone.
I'm feeling quite a newbie. 
 
To be explicitly honest I would love to find someone interested in help me out, even sporadically or just when he/she wants/can.
If for you make sense I can open compleatly all the processes of the making including the "ownership" of the Installation, live or whatever will be.. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't think to have the best Ideas of the world, I just copy, or better I take inspiration from other artists that with their works give me a solid starting point.

Said that, I would like to do it collectively and I think that the work belongs to whoever does it.

I usually take inspirations or I copy:
- ideas from other artists, musicians or creatves.
- quite often the code is copied from solutions or implementations made by others.
- the workflow is taken step by step from some tutorials..and so on.. 

For example I copied the way to think/structure a performance from here:
https://youtu.be/P85X1Ut3Hfc

or from here a bunch of synths:
https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/scbookcode

 
A nice thing that I learnt when I studied eletroacustic music from one of my teacher was : "music is sharing" I know that could sounds a bit of a rethoric sentence but I like to think that could be true.
Now, flying down to the planet earth, I kindly ask you your support hoping that this could become a nice moment to confront eachother, bringing out a lean and solid approach to tackle a performative project.

I also hope that this moment of sharing, if it will be so, could become an interesting "place" to discuss how a project can be structured in its entirety, from the development of the idea, which constantly requires to be modified according to the real possibilities and to the limits, up to the physical realization or the technicalities of programming.

Let's try to see what will happen :) 
Here there is a link to the repo on github:
https://github.com/RandColors/project-guidance

For now there is just a file for example.

## About the Performative-Installation  ##
My first multimedia performance installation is based on three elements: Light, Sound and Mechanical Laser oscilloscopes.
Currently being in a preliminary phase I have mounted 6 circular equidistant bulbs attached to the ceiling of a room that is dedicated to the development of this installation.

The dimmer I use is this one:

- user manual: https://www.strumentimusicali.net/manuali/PROEL_PLDM6KN_IT.pdf

- modification with power plugs and sockets, in order to attach different lamps or "objects" to the dimmer.

- C:\Users\ET\Desktop\cartella condivisa\img\dimmer Connections

I'm in Italy, anyway I'm not recommending to buy stuff from where I bought them, it's just for for illustrative purposes and as far as I know, there are cheaper places to buy these items, just in case you are interested.


I found this cheap solution, that it works quite well, and I'm happy to share because I guess It could be used in a lot of  contexts where a maximum of 8 loudspeakers is needed.

## 1 LIGHTS/DIMMER ##
At the moment I'm working with lights only, writing some obvious/foundamental pattern beheviours.

## 2 SOUND /LOUDSPEAKERS ##
Video snippet using PanAz with the loudspeakers:
https://youtu.be/BdYn25hI9Ik

This Idea was taken from: 

**Marcus Fisher**

http://mapmap.ch/index.php/ongoing/multiples/
https://youtu.be/9tW34OvHs24

I hypothesized an approach to sound design, where I physically go to put on and off objects that want to vibrate inside  the loudspeakers.

The objects that I have identified as interesting are:

- rattles
- plastic caps
- glass eroded by the sea
- hunting-fishing sinkers
- leaves and seeds

and casekeeper .. beer bottle caps :)

Here an example with the lights too. 
One to one approach(for light one correspond spaeker one.. and so on..)

## 3 MECHANICAL LASER OSCILLOSCOPE ##
Another thing that fascinated me a lot was this "experiment" that I saw on youtube:

Laser + mirror + sound
https://youtu.be/C-V1uXeyGmg

I then decided to try it and I bought the Balloons, lasers and mirrors.

I then looked for information about the generation of Lissajous figures and how an Oscilloscope works.

There are fundamental differences between this way of viewing sound and a real oscilloscope, first of all it is not possible to view the high frequencies, this approach works well only in the low and medium range and I have to build a way to make the system solid and have the certainty that the figure produced will be replicable. I think this will be done with 3d printing techniques, in order to decide the angle and distance between laser and mirror, and it would be essential to find a way to stretch the balloon membrane homogeneously.

For this approach, however, I based myself on additive synthesis and then I found Phase Modulation extremely interesting.

Just a couple of video snippets taken for memo purposes.
complex waveforms additive synthesis:
https://youtu.be/bDcMkBVLNmk

Phase Modulation: https://youtu.be/DZSLobBCEdQ


and I found some intersting ideas to compose waveforms from this book:
 https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mapping-and-visualization-supercollider#tab-label-table.of.contents

L'unico inconveniente è che avrei voluto non sentire i suoni prodotti ma rimanere in un range subsonico, purtroppo, in questo modo non è molto interessante dal punto di vista visivo. 
Ho anche provato a prendere una lavagnetta luminosa per vedere se era possibile scrivere su di essa con la luce laser in maniera tale da andare a disegnare su di essa l'intero tracciato, ma non ho avuto fortuna a riguardo per ora.


These are the first 3 elements that I am interested to explore.

1 What and how is it possible to do with 6 lights? (search and structuring of a phrasebook)
2 Speakers like Actuator (From punctual to continuous) (Low and Infrasonic music).
3 Draw with sound. waveform composition.


In the end the first thing I'm working on is copying from this teaser the different lights movements.

### Tech ###
Technical things that looks really intersting and why I would like to Use the Pattern Libary in conjunction with Envelopes.

Accelerando/decelerando con Envelopes per definire il numero di eventi al secondo.
Guarda il odice che avevi per capire quale è il suono e che "score" ed a che tipo di controlloMIDI è associato. 

- Start Up file (cosa includere)
-  
- Animation Techniques
- ease functions 
- avere pezzi di timeline algoritmica per scrivere delle gesture precise
- modificare 

Primo Argomento da affrontare:
Gesture luminose prese dal teaser di Takami Nakamoto.

- Elenco dei controller MIDI.
- Ipotizza la divisione dei files. 
- vedi il carica files automatico.
- vedi le regole di sintassi suggerite.

I know that she wrote a Quark to work with dimmers and it's clear from her works that it works really well..  

From a musical performance point of view I would love to bring togheter two approaches ,
the first one based on pre-written patterns that I have only to manipulate or play like they are, and the second one based on playing a single note every time a key is pressed , so it's like a traditional instrument or better like a drums played with a keyboard.. 
Here a first list of artists to which I want to inspire for this project: 

### Sound inspirations ###

**Gavin-Harrison-Rhythmic-Illusions**

http://www.gavharrison.com/ 
From this book it's possible to read/study and listen to 
a really nice examples of Rhythmic modulations, polymeters My goal in this regard is just to create polimeters in between from sounds Pattern and light Patterns.

####2 Controllerism Like approach ####
**Pallavi e Ritmi **

I'm very fascinated by this piece, 
that is rich of rhythmic Ideas and could let me expand in this direction.

**Hip-hop/afro/dub/funk/fusion drums Grooves**


### Lighting Inspirations ###
I found some difficulties to find  artists that work
with lightsbulbs in a musical context.

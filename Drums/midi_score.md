Just to be clear, I'm trying to find a plesant way to work with sc.

So I thought that I prefer to work by writing score fragments in a software that exports midi files which I subsequently modify in sc.
All this to have the simplicity and clarity of traditional writing and the possibilities offered by sc to create variations, mainly my idea is to derive new scores from fragments.

I found the wslib Quark, which contains SimpleMIDIFile.
